A simple single page webapp that acts as a todo list tracker that you can add and remove items to your todo list.
Front end made using simple HTML/CSS and jQuery.

## Motivation

An assignment from [The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp
](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/) to implement a RESTful API (using node and express) and connecting it to a mongo database (hosted by mongolabs).

## Installation

Clone the repository and set the environment variable `TODOAPIDATABASE` to the database you wish to use. By default it will use the mongolabs database I have set up. Then run `node todoapi\index.js` to load the API and simple HTML/CSS version. To run the react version, run the load the API then run `npm start` in the `todosfrontend` directory.
