## Synopsis

A simple single page webapp that acts as a todo list tracker that you can add and remove items to your todo list.
Front end made using ReactJS.
Back end made using node, express, and mongo database.

## Motivation

An assignment from [The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp
](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/) to implement a RESTful API (using node and express) and connecting it to a mongo database (hosted by mongolabs) and creating the front end using ReactJS.

## Installation

Clone the repository and set the environment variable `TODOAPIDATABASE` to the database you wish to use. By default it will use the mongolabs database I have set up.

## API Reference

API is currently hosted on heroku.
